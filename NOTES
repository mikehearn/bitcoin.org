RUNNING THE SITE LOCALLY

This site is compiled by a tool called Jekyll into files in _site. To install
Jekyll you need RubyGems and then run "gem install jekyll" as root.
Unfortunately this is very likely to not work properly (at least on MacOS) and
leave you with a non-functioning install that complaints at startup about
missing modules. Just use "gem install" on them in sequence. If it whinges
about a program called "lessc" know that the correct gem to install is actually
called "less". It's a CSS language extension compiler.

You can start jekyll like this:

  jekyll --server --auto

It listens on port 4000.

Jekyll is extremely slow. The first time you run it, it will start listening
on port 4000 but serve 404s for anything you try. Go get a cup of tea, come
back and try again.

It will watch your directory so when you edit a file, wait a bit and the 
changes will be reflected in your browser when you refresh automatically.

If you modify _config.yaml it will delete everything and you have to wait
for it to regenerate again.
